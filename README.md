# The Wingly Changelog

## Getting Started

First create a `.env` file and add a `VITE_GH_TOKEN` key to it.
The value of this key should be a GitHub personal access token with read access to use names/emails.
After that, install via pnpm and run the dev server for `slides/latest.md`:

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
